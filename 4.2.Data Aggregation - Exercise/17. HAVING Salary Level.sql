-- Write a SQL query to retrieve the number of employees and salary level of each department 
-- 	from the "employees" table. 
-- 	The "salary_level" column should be determined based on the following rules:
-- if the average "salary" of a department is above 50,000, the salary level is "Above average"
-- if the average "salary" of a department is below or equal to 50,000, the salary level is "Below average"
-- only departments with an average "salary" above 30,000 should be included in the result.
-- The resulting dataset should encompass the subsequent columns: "department_id", 
-- "num_employees" and "salary_level". Arrange the output based on the "department_id".
