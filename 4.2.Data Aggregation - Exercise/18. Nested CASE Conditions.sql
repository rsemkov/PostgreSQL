-- To create a view ("view_performance_rating"), select the "first_name", "last_name", "job_title", 
-- "salary", and "department_id" from the "employees" table. Then, use the following conditions 
-- to generate the "performance_rating" column:
	
-- if an employee's "salary" is greater than or equal to 25,000 and 
-- their " job_title" starts with 'Senior%', their "performance_rating" should be "High-performing Senior"
	
-- if an employee's "salary" is greater than or equal to 25,000 
-- and their "job_title" does not start with "Senior", their "performance_rating" should be "High-performing Employee"
	
-- if neither of the above criteria is met, the employee's "performance_rating" should be "Average-performing".
