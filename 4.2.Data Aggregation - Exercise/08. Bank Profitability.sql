-- Mr. Bodrog is interested in the profitability of the bank 
-- and wants to know the average interest rates of all "deposit_groups" rounded down to the nearest integer.
-- The query should categorize the deposits based on whether they have expired or not and retrieve 
-- data only for deposits that have a "deposit_start_date" after '1985-01-01'. The results should be 
-- sorted in descending order by "deposit_group" and ascending order by the "is_deposit_expired" flag.
