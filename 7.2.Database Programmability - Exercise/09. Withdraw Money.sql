-- Your task is to create a stored procedure in PostgreSQL called "sp_withdraw_money", which will withdraw money 
-- from an existing account. The procedure should have two parameters:
	
-- *"account_id" - an integer representing the "id" of the account to withdraw money from;
-- *"money_amount" - a numeric value with a precision of up to four digits after the decimal point representing the amount of money to withdraw.

-- The procedure should update the account's "balance" by subtracting the withdrawn amount of money 
-- only if the account has enough balance to make the transaction. If the account balance is not sufficient 
-- to withdraw the specified amount, it should raise a notice indicating the insufficient balance.
