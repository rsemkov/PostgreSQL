-- The stored procedure should be named "sp_deposit_money" and should have two parameters:
-- "account_id" - an integer that identifies the account where the money is to be deposited;
-- "money_amount" - a numeric value with a maximum precision of four digits after the decimal point, 
-- which specifies the amount of money to be deposited.
-- The stored procedure should increase the account's "balance" by adding the deposited amount of money. 
-- After that, it should commit the transaction to guarantee that the modifications are saved.
