-- Write an SQL query to select the "elevation" and "peak_name" columns from the 
-- "peaks" table where the "elevation" is greater than or equal to 4884. 
-- Concatenate them with a single space, use the REPEAT() function to create 
-- an arrow between them "--->>", and name the new column "Elevation --->> Peak Name".
