-- To generate a report displaying the user count grouped by their initials, 
-- you can utilize an SQL query. This query involves selecting the initial two characters 
-- from the "first_name" column of the "users" table and storing them in a newly created column 
-- named "initials". Afterward, you can use the GROUP BY clause to group the users based on their initials. 
-- Then, employ the COUNT() function to retrieve the number of users in each group, and name the resulting 
-- column "user_count". Finally, you can arrange the resulting data in descending order according to the 
-- "user_count" column. In cases where multiple groups have the same count, you can further sort them 
-- alphabetically based on their "initials".
