-- Write a SQL query that selects the first 10 bookings in the "bookings" table, along with their 
-- corresponding customer's full name from the "customers" table. If any column in the RIGHT table does 
-- not have booking information available, it should still be included in the result set.
-- select the " booking_id" column from the "bookings" table
-- select the "starts_at" column from the "bookings" table, convert it to a date format
-- select the "apartment_id" column from the "bookings" table
-- select the concatenated "first_name" and "last_name" columns from the "customers" table, renaming the resulting column as "customer_name"
-- order the outcome in ascending order based on the "Customer Name" column
