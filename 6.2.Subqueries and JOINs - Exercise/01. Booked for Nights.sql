-- Perform a JOIN operation between the "apartments" table and the "bookings" table to retrieve only matching rows. 
-- The resulting columns should be renamed as "apartment_address" for the concatenated "address" and "address_2" 
-- columns and "nights" for the "booked_for" column. Conclude by arranging the outcome in ascending order based 
-- on the "apartment_id" column.
