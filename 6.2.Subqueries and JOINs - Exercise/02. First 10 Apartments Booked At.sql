SELECT 
	a.name, a.country, DATE(b.booked_at)
FROM apartments AS a
	LEFT JOIN bookings AS b
	USING(booking_id)
LIMIT 10

-- select the "name" column from the "apartments" table 
-- select the "country" column from the "apartments" table 
-- select the "booked_at" column from the "bookings" table, convert it to a date format
