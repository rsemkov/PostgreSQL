SELECT id, CONCAT_WS(' ', first_name, last_name) AS "full_name", job_title
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name ASC
LIMIT 50

-- Develop a SQL query that selects from the "employees" table "id", "first_name", "last_name", and 
-- "job_title". Combine the "first_name" and "last_name" fields into a single field called "full_name". 
-- Sort them by the "first_name" field in ascending alphabetical order. Finally, LIMIT the results to 50.
