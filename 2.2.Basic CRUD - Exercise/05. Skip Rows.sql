-- Create a SQL query that selects the "employees" records including their 
-- 	"id", "first_name", "middle_name", "last_name", and "hire_date". 
-- 	Rename the "id" column as "id". Combine the "first_name", "middle_name" and "last_name", 
-- 	fields into a single field called "full_name".  Sort the results by the 
-- 	"hire_date" field in ascending order. Lastly, OFFSET the results by 10 rows.
