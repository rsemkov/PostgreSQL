-- Write SQL queries to create two new tables: "customers" and "contacts". 
-- 	The "customers" table should have a column for "customer_name", and the "contacts" 
-- 	table should contain columns for "contact_name", "phone", "email", and "customer_id". 
-- 	You can choose the data type for each column based on your preference, but it's important 
-- 	to ensure that each table has a unique identifier.
-- To set up the foreign keys correctly, make sure that when a record in the "customers" table is deleted, 
-- 	the corresponding records in the "contacts" table have their "customer_id" value set to NULL. 
-- 	Additionally, when a row in the "customers" table is updated, ensure that matching rows in the 
-- 	"contacts" table are also updated accordingly.

-- Finally, remove the row from the "customers" table where the value of the "id" column matches 1.
